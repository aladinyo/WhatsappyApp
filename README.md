Then setup an algolia search project then put your keys in "backend/index.js" and "src/Sidebar.js".
# Running the app
After setting up the project in the root folder run "npm run start" to run the frontend and then navigate to "backend" folder and run "npm run index.js" to run the backend.
# building the app
To build the app run in the root folder "npm run build" you get the production code of your frontend in the build folder you can use it to host the app (you can set up firebase hosting for that) also you can host the backend folder in a node js hosting platform like heroku just make sure that your hosting service will run a worker (npm run index.js).
